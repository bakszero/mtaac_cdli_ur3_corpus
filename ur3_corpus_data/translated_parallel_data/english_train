the king whom Enlil
in his heart

as the shepherd of the country

the mighty king ,
king of Ur

When Enlil
life
and longevity ,
crown and tiara ,
a scepter of long days ,
the throne of kingship
with a secure foundation ,
years of abundance ,
a flood of weapons
which cast forth great fearsomeness ,
the royal ankara-weapon
the weapon of war ,
the weapon of heroism ,
whose fearsomeness and divine radiance
reaches up to heaven ,
whose roar
covers the rebel lands
from across
the Lower Sea
to the Upper Sea ,
the river …
All the great mountain ranges ,
the distant mountain places ,
the peoples ,
all their lords and enthroned ones ,

the king nominated by An ,
bowing down at his feet ,
when Enlil ,
the lord through whose command
all is created ,
to Šū-Sîn ,
his king chosen by  sacred heart ,
had given  to him —
At that time

Their kings
with their war and battle
confronted him .
Šū-Sîn ,
the mighty king ,
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters ,
by the power of Enlil
his master ,
and by the command of Ninlil ,
his beloved mistress ,
in those wars and battles
he was repeatedly victorious .
Their head warriors
he mowed down .
Their runners
he weakened .
Their strong and weak
he killed like dogs .
The heads of their righteous and treacherous ones
he strewed like seeds .
Their human corpses
he piled up like sheaves .
All their lords and enthroned ones
he took into capitivity .
All the great governors
of the territories
of Zabšali
and
all the governors
of the cites
whom he had brought back from the wars ,
their governors and enthroned ones
when he had taken them prisoner ,
…
…
before Enlil
and Ninlil
he did …
The young men
who from the grasp of battle
had fallen out ,
and to their cities
like  birds had saved their lives ,
did not escape his hand .
Towards their cities
like an Anzu-eagle he himself
screeched .
Their settled cities and towns
he made into ruined mounds ,
and their walls
he demolished .
The young men of their cities
which he had conquered
he removed their eyes ,
and in the orchards of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
in the orchards of the great gods
he made them into domestic servants .
Further , the young women
of those cities
which he had conquered
in the weaving-houses
of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
the temples of the great gods
he offered as gifts .
Their cattle , sheep , goats and donkeys
which he brought in
and in the temples of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
the temples of the great gods
he sacrificed them .
Gold and silver
and things fashioned
into big sacks
he filled .
Copper ,
and tin ,
bronze ,
and things fashioned from them
he tied onto the backs of donkeys ,
and for the temples of Enlil ,
Ninlil ,
and
the temples of the great gods
into treasures
he made them .
Šū-Sîn ,
the king nominated by An ,
given supreme power
by Enlil ,
that from this day foreward
the praise of them
should not fall from the lips ,
but should  be handed down -
Bulma ,
in the land of Šimaški ,
like …
he cast down .
The population ,
females and males ,
those living beings having names
he … with weapons .
He having revealed it to …
for the …
that his might
and power
shall unto distant times
not be erased ,
he … it to their farthest reaches .
… Habūra
and
Mardama
Šū-Sîn ,
the king and shepherd of the Black-Headed Folk
…
he raised there
and covered them with the garment of it .
Gold and silver
to mine
he set them .
At that time ,
Šū-Sîn ,
the mighty king ,
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters ,
the gold
of the territories
of Šimaški ,
which he had made into booty ,
into  stone figure of himself
he fashioned ,
and to Enlil ,
his master ,
for his life
he dedicated it .
A person who an order of wickedness
shall issue against it ,
and this inscription
shall erase
and his own name
shall write upon it ,
or that which I have fashioned
he shall destroy ,
that person
may Enlil ,
the king of all the lands ,
and Ninlil ,
the queen of the gods ,
curse .
May Ninurta ,
the mighty warrior
of Enlil ,
be the bailiff of this .
